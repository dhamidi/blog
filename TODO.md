# Technical

## Required

- Add tests.

  Since this time it seems like the code is going to stick around for
  some time, and not just a few-hour throwaway prototype, writing tests
  is not a wasted effort.

## Nice-to-have

- An additional event store implementation

  Obvious candidates for backends are Sqlite, Redis or Postgres.
  Bolt[1] looks interesting too, especially from an operational point of
  view (i.e. no additional service necessary).
