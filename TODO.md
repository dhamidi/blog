# Technical

## Required

- Add tests.

  Since this time it seems like the code is going to stick around for
  some time, and not just a few-hour throwaway prototype, writing tests
  is not a wasted effort.

# Features

## Required

- Provide a frontend for rewording posts.

## Nice-to-have

- Generate/maintain a sitemap.xml

  This feature is mainly here to explore how easy it is to have maintain
  multiple different views.  I suspect it is pretty easy.
